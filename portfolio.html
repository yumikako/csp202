    The background of the apple tree and the hill will be drawn to start the game.
    In this project, the user will be asked 
    to input a number from 1 through 6 to determine the amount of apples which will appear onto the tree. Then, it proceeds
    to ask the size of the apples which are small or large. The program then begins to draw the specified amount of apples in
    the corresponding size. The colors of each apples are randomized between red, green, and gold. Afterwards, the user is 
    given a prompt to begin the apple drop which causes the apples to fall from the tree and bounce off the hill. </p><style="width:95%>

    In this project, the user will fly around space controlling a spaceship using the arrow keys to get to the "planets" or the circular
    shapes seen on the screen. The player will maneuver the spaceship by moving it up and down to got forwards or backwards
    through the yse of PgUp and PgDn keys. The players will move left and right to move side to side 
    using the end and home arrow keys. Once you have began moving the spaceship, use it to go around the screen and look 
    for the circular planets. Once your spaceship comes in contact with the planets, you will gain a point. Once you have a total
    of ten points, the game will be finished. </p><style="width:95%>

    In this project, the objective of this game is to see which player can get the most stones into their pocket. 
    One player will start the game by picking any pocket containing stones from their own side.
    The player will remove all the stones from that pocket, and deposit one stone at a time into neighboring pockets
    going counter-clockwise until the stones run out.If a player encounters their own store, a stone is deposited in it.
    If there are enough stones to go past the player’s own store, stones are deposited continuing on the other 
    side’s pockets. However, if they encounter the other player’s store, that store is skipped over. If the last stone 
    is deposited in the player’s own store, the player gets another turn. If the last stone is placed in an empty pocket 
    on the player’s own side, the player takes this stone as well as the other player’s stones across from the empty 
    pocket landed in, and places them in their own store. When all six pockets on one side are emptied the game ends. 
    Each player will count the number of stones in their store. The player who has the most stones in their store wins.

    booth using the arrow keys. Then you get tickets at the ticket booth by using the arrow keys. 
    After that you see the inside of the carnival and can go to a game. This game displays 
    nine balloons and the goal is to pop them all.
